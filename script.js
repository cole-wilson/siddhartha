	// Intro:
	`<h1>Herman Hesse's Use of Govinda in <i>Siddhartha</i></h1> <span center>by Cole Wilson</span> <p>I chose to focus on the following question for my analysis:</p> <blockquote><i>Govinda has several meetings with Siddhartha, spanning all stages of his life. At each meeting Siddhartha appears different to Govinda. How does this fluidity of Siddharthaâ€™s personality and circumstances contribute to his eventual understanding of life, and how does Hesse use Govinda to highlight this?</i></blockquote> <p>On this website, I've highlighted each of Siddhartha's six conversations with Govinda, and their impact. Finally, there is a conclusion section that provides an analysis and a formal answer to the question.</p>`,
